I am a PhD student in Computer Science at The Ohio State University, with a keen interest in computer graphics, games, and animation research. My primary research area is in computer games, where I use metric-driven fun factor design to create engaging video games. I explore existing literature on abstract fun aspects and quantify them using procedural content generation techniques.

Apart from my research, I also enjoy dabbling in computer arts. I use Houdini to create and simulate interesting art pieces using techniques such as geometric modeling and finite element modeling. Itâ€™s fascinating to see how technology can be used to create beautiful art!
